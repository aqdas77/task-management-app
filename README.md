# Task App with JWT Authentication

Task App is a powerful and secure task management application designed to help you stay organized and productive. Easily create, update, and manage your tasks with this user-friendly web-based application, all while benefiting from JWT-based user authentication for enhanced security.

## Features
JWT User Authentication: Securely create an account, log in, and access your tasks using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for robust authentication and authorization.

Task Creation: Add new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority levels.

Task List: View and manage your tasks in a clear and organized list format.

Task Details: Access detailed information about each task, including its description and due date.

Task Editing: Edit task details, update due dates, and change priority levels as needed.

Task Deletion: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks from your list.

Responsive Design: Enjoy a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Access the Application:
Open your web browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:3000``` (or the specified port).

## JWT Authentication
Task App uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization. Here's how JWT authentication works:

**User Registration**: Users can securely create an account with a unique username and a strong password.

**User Login**: Upon successful registration, users can log in using their credentials, and the server will issue a JWT for subsequent authentication.

**JWT Authorization**: The JWT is used to authorize users and grant access to their tasks. It is included in the request headers for protected routes.

**Token Expiration**: JWTs have a configurable expiration time to enhance security. Users will need to log in again after the token expires.

**Middleware**: Middleware is employed to validate JWTs on protected routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access their tasks.

**Logout**: Users can log out, which invalidates their JWT, further enhancing security.

## Technologies Used
**Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment.

**Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.

**MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing task data.

**EJS**: Templating engine for rendering views.

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Secure user authentication and authorization.

**Material UI**: Front-end CSS framework for responsive design.
